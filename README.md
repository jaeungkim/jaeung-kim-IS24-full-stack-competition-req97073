## Introduction

The BC Government Ministry of Citizens' Services Information Management Branch (IMB) is currently trying to catalog current modern web applications in GitHub, as well as new products that are coming up in the future. Currently, there are 40 products marked for modernization that need to be cataloged, as well as 3 products that are either actively being developed or in a maintenance lifecycle.

This application provides a simple way to display, create and edit information related to these web applications. The user base for this application will include a wide array of technical skills, therefore making this application as simple as possible to use is being stressed by the IMB Senior Leadership Team (SLT).

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in building this web application:

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Faker.js,
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Database: MongoDB
